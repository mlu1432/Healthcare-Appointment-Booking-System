# Set permissions for GitHub Pages deployment
permissions:
  contents: read   # Read repository contents
  pages: write     # Allow writing to GitHub Pages

jobs:
  # Build job: Prepares the Next.js site for deployment
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository code
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"  # Use Node.js version 20
          cache: "npm"  # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds

      # Step 3: Install dependencies inside the backend folder
      - name: Install Backend Dependencies
        working-directory: firstcare-backend
        run: npm ci  # Uses 'ci' for cleaner, more reliable installs

      # Step 4: Install dependencies inside the frontend folder
      - name: Install Frontend Dependencies
        working-directory: firstcare-frontend
        run: npm ci

      # Step 5: Start the backend (if needed for frontend build)
      - name: Start Backend (Optional)
        working-directory: firstcare-backend
        run: nohup npm start &  # Runs backend in the background

      # Step 6: Build the Next.js app
      - name: Build Next.js App
        working-directory: firstcare-frontend
        run: npm run build  # Generates the optimized production build

      # Step 7: Export the site as static files for GitHub Pages
      - name: Export Static Files
        working-directory: firstcare-frontend
        run: npm run export  # Converts Next.js pages into static HTML

      # Step 8: Upload the built static files as an artifact for deployment
      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: firstcare-frontend/out  # Upload the "out" directory for deployment

  # Deploy job: Deploys the built site to GitHub Pages
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
