# Set permissions for GitHub Pages deployment
permissions:
  contents: read   # Read repository contents
  pages: write     # Allow writing to GitHub Pages

jobs:
  # Build job: Prepares the Next.js site for deployment
  build:

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository code
      - name: Checkout Repository

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment

      # Step 3: Install dependencies inside the frontend folder
      - name: Install Dependencies
        working-directory: firstcare-frontend  # Navigate to frontend directory
        run: npm install  # Install dependencies from package.json

      # Step 4: Build the Next.js app
      - name: Build Next.js App
        working-directory: firstcare-frontend

      # Step 5: Export the site as static files for GitHub Pages
      - name: Export Static Files
        working-directory: firstcare-frontend
        run: npm run export  # Converts Next.js pages into static HTML
